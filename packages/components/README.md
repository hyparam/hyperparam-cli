# React components for hyparam apps

This package contains the React components for the hyparam apps.

It depends on [hyparquet](https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet), [hyparquet-compressors](https://github.com/hyparam/hyparquet-compressors), [hightable](https://github.com/hyparam/hightable/), and requires React to be installed (peer-dependency).

It is used in [hyperparam](https://github.com/hyparam/hyperparam-cli/tree/master/packages/cli).

It also contains utilities, in the lib/ subdirectory, that can be used without React. They are used in:
- [hyperparam](https://github.com/hyparam/hyperparam-cli/tree/master/packages/cli)
- [hyparquet-demo](https://github.com/hyparam/hyperparam-cli/tree/master/apps/hyparquet-demo)
- [hightable-demo](https://github.com/hyparam/hyperparam-cli/tree/master/apps/hightable-demo)
- [@hyparam/components](https://github.com/hyparam/hyperparam-cli/tree/master/packages/components)
